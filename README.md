# Kaggle-Competitions

Repository for my Getting Started Kaggle competition submissions.

I created all the .py files in jupyter notebooks, however there was an error initially when downloading as .ipynb so I've uplaoded them as .py. The ipynb files are now in their respective folder along with the .py files.
